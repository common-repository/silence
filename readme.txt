Disables the plugin update checking and notification system.

== Description ==

This plugin disables the WordPress update notifications, as well as update notifications of different plugins. It is ideal to deliver a complete WordPress and not bother the user with alerts. Silence!

= Please note! =

It's *very* important that you keep your WordPress plugins up to date. If you don't, your blog or website could be susceptible to security vulnerabilities or performance issues. If you use this plugin, you must make sure you keep yourself up to date with new releases of your active plugins and update them as new versions are released.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the ZIP file and drop the folder straight into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to disable the plugin update system? =

Most people will not want to (and should not) disable this feature. It's a fantastic feature WordPress and I'm fully in support of it. However, administrators who maintain multiple installations of WordPress on behalf of other people (eg. clients) may not want plugin update notifications to be shown to the users of these installations. This plugin is for them.

= To enable notifications should disable the plugin again? =

Not necessary. You just need to enter the panel "Silence Options" and from that place can be given whether to enable / disable notifications.
